title: Mathlib Reviewer Bootcamp 2026 (MRB2026)
---

The first ever edition of the Mathlib Reviewer Bootcamp will be a week-long
workshop hosted at Stockholm University in **Stockholm, Sweden**
on **30th March-3rd April 2026**.

Its goal is to make existing Lean experts proficient at reviewing
pull requests to [Mathlib](http://leanprover-community.github.io/),
the mathematics library of [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/).

## Why

The growth of Mathlib is currently bottlenecked by the slowness
of the review process.
It can take upwards to months for some contributors' work to even be looked at.

The [Mathlib Initiative](https://mathlib-initiative.org/) is one answer
to this problem, by allowing existing reviewers to spend more time reviewing.
However, this doesn't solve the underlying problem of the imbalance
of our community towards newcomers created by the huge rise of interest
in formalisation in recent years.

We must also strengthen the newcomer-to-contributor-to-reviewer pipeline.
The first step of this pipeline is now widely ensured through both in-person
mentoring at universities and online through the review process.
The second step of this pipeline, however, currently is a solitary process
of learning by doing with no mentoring nor learning resources available.

We are a small group of expert reviewers who want to divert the trend
by passing on our hard-learned reviewing knowledge and skills

## What

The workshop will consist of lectures on reviewing practices
(style, etiquette...) and tool proficiency (vscode, github),
followed by practice sessions in small groups of mentees/mentors.

The mentorship started then is planned to continue over several months.

# Applications

The ideal applicant should have a solid knowledge of Lean and a track record
of contributions to Mathlib (at least 10 PRs merged, as a rule of thumb).
They should furthermore be motivated to advance the community through reviewing
and in particular be ready to dedicate time to it in the future.
To ensure appropriate mentoring, we will prioritise applicants interested in
combinatorics, order theory, convex analysis, <!-- Yael -->
commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, category theory, <!-- Andrew -->
differential geometry, topology, metaprogramming. <!-- Michael -->

To apply, please send an email to yael.dillies@math.su.se with subject
*MRB 2026 - Applicant name* by **28th February 2026** containing:
* your review and mathematical interests,
* a short summary of your experience with Lean/Mathlib,
* a few sentences about your motivation.

Once you have been accepted, we will need the following information for the hotel booking:
* your email address
* your date of birth
* your mobile phone number
