### What

A reading group run by [Yaël Dillies](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/yadi8568-1.745057)
where we discuss different aspects of interactive theorem proving, programming,
and metaprogramming in Lean.

Everyone is welcome to join!
More experienced users are welcome to propose projects in formalization,
programming, or metaprogramming.

If you are curious about Lean but don’t have much experience, you’re also welcome —
this is a great learning opportunity, and we’re open to all levels.
